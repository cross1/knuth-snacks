    <p>
      KnuthSnacks started when someone here at Mudd's Summer of CS Program asked
      Cassie where the chips were because there were two containers of salsa in
      the fridge and no chips. Cassie snarkily replied that there were chips, in
      fact, and that they were in one of the cabinets. This led her to think about
      KnuthSnacks, a way for people using the CS Kitchen to know which snacks
      are stocked, and where they are stored.
